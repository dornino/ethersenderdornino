const fromAddress = '0xYourSenderEthereumAddress';
const toAddress = '0xYourRecipientEthereumAddress';
const amountInEther = 0.1;
const privateKey = 'YourPrivateKey';

sendEther(fromAddress, toAddress, amountInEther, privateKey)
    .then(txReceipt => {
        if (txReceipt !== null) {
            console.log('Transaction successful! Transaction hash:', txReceipt.transactionHash);
        } else {
            console.log('Transaction failed.');
